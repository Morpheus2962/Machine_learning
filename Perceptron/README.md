# Perceptron:
  
  
This is implementation of the Perceptron algorithm in Python. 
I wanted  gain an understanding of how Neural Networks work and started with the simplest one. 
This is an easy algorithm, although easy to understand, is not very efficient. 

A Perceptron is used to define a hyperplane which divides the input space into two half-spaces and can be used to make binary classification.

perceptron.py file contains the model of Perceptron. You can use it to train some simple data. I have made test.py if you want to test the model.
 ## Usage

**Dependencies**

The only Python dependencies not in the standard library are:

  * numpy
  * scikit-learn
  * matplotlib
  * tqdm

Although i have used above libraries they are not required to make Perceptron model.

If you only want to use perceptron.py you only need to install numpy library

**Training**

To use this you need to install required libraries.

To install required libraries run:

      $ pip install -r requirements.txt    

To test the model run:

      $ python test.py
