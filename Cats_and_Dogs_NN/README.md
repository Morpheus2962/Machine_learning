# Cats and Dogs Convolutional Neural Network:
  
  
This is my first attempt to make a Convolutional nueral network to make  a classifier. I have used Kaggle cats and dogs data as training data. I learned this all from Sentdex's tutorial. 
 
 ## Usage

**Dependencies**

The only Python dependencies not in the standard library are:

  * tensorflow
  * opencv
  * numpy


**Training**

To use this you need to make some changes. check prerequisite.txt

First run Create_Training_DATA.py to make training data by:

      $ python Create_Training_DATA.py      

Then you can train the network:

      $ python Model.py
      
To predict data run:

      $ python predict.py
