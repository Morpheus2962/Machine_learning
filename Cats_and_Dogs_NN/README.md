# Cats and Dogs Convolutional Neural Network:
  -This is my first attempt to make a Convolutional nueral network to make  a classifier.
  -I have used Kaggle cats and dogs data as training data.
  -I learned this all from Sentdex's tutorial. 
 
 ## Usage

**Dependencies**

The only Python dependencies not in the standard library are:

  * tensorflow
  * opencv
  * numpy


**Training**
To use this you need to make some changes. check prerequisite.txt
The training and testing data is available from the Kaggle challenge [data page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/data) and should be placed in a top level `data/` directory

Then you can train the network:

      $ python model.py
