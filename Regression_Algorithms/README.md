# Regression Algorithms:
  
  
This directory contains various Machine Learning Regression Algorithms.





Regression algorithms fall under the family of Supervised Machine Learning algorithms which is a subset of machine learning algorithms. 
One of the main features of supervised learning algorithms is that they model dependencies and relationships between the target output and input features to predict the value for new data. 
Regression algorithms predict the output values based on input features from the data fed in the system. 
The go-to methodology is the algorithm builds a model on the features of training data and using the model to predict the value for new data.

**Applications**

The applications of ML regression algorithms are as follows:

  * Forecasting or Predictive analysis :−  *One of the important uses of regression is forecasting or predictive analysis. For example, we can forecast GDP, oil prices or in simple words the quantitative data that changes with the passage of time.*
  * Optimization :−  *We can optimize business processes with the help of regression. For example, a store manager can create a statistical model to understand the peek time of coming of customers.*

  * Error correction :−  *In business, taking correct decision is equally important as optimizing the business process. Regression can help us to take correct decision as well in correcting the already implemented decision.*

  * Economics :−  *It is the most used tool in economics. We can use regression to predict supply, demand, consumption, inventory investment etc.*

  * Finance :−  *A financial company is always interested in minimizing the risk portfolio and want to know the factors that affects the customers. All these can be predicted with the help of regression model.*
